            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>
            Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early schooling was suspended in 1967 as a result
            of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served <br>
            in the Biafran army. After the war he completed high-school equivalence through self-study. He is married to
            Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American
            microbiologist.[5]

                Court case and the denial of degree
            </h2>
            <p>
                Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991.
                His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external <br> examiners and thus he was not awarded
                the degree.
                Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a violation of his
                civil rights and that the <br> university had discriminated against him in several ways because of his race.
                The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state Court of Appeals.[8]

                Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir
                modeling.[1]
